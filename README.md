This is a portfoilio site designed around a hexagonal theme. 
The main body of the site is a collection of different "honeycombs" that animate and reorder continuously
based on the size of the screen. The shapes were built in css and manipulated using jquery, and the success
of this functionality comes in large part from this plug in: http://www.jqueryscript.net/layout/jQuery-Plugin-For-Responsive-Hexagon-Grid-Layout-Honeycombs.html

The photos ($copyKate Shirley) and artwork (All in public collections at the Art Institute of Chicago) will be 
updated with photos of individual projects, and the site will eventually link to project pages. 

The site has two responsive breakpoints (though the honeycombs are responsive at any viewport size) at 900 and 500. 
In the 2.0 version of this website I will fix it so that the solid color hexagons disappear on the phone version
to condesnse the content. 

Eventually I would also like to make ajax calls to the twitter and github APIs, and build a blog on the site in Jekyll.
